# My Kubernetes Cookbook
This cookbook is maintained to keep track of my k8s concepts learning. 



## What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem.

## Kubernetes Architecture 
Kubernetes consists of two type of nodes:
1. Control Plane (Master)
2. Worker Node (Slave)


### Control Plane Components
Control Plane runs following components to make it a master node: 
- Kube API Server
- ETCD (key-value datastore)
- Kube Scheduler 
- Kube Controller Manager
  - Node Controller
  - Job Controller
  - ServiceAccount Controller
  - EndpointSlice Controller

### Worker Node Components
Worker node runs following components: 
- Kubelet 
- Kube-proxy 
- Container Runtime
