## What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem.

## Kubernetes Architecture 
Kubernetes consists of two type of nodes:
1. Control Plane (Master)
2. Worker Node (Slave)


### Control Plane Components
Control Plane runs following components to make it a master node: 
- Kube API Server
- ETCD (key-value datastore)
- Kube Scheduler 
- Kube Controller Manager
  - Node Controller
  - Job Controller
  - ServiceAccount Controller
  - EndpointSlice Controller

### Worker Node Components
Worker node runs following components: 
- Kubelet 
- Kube-proxy 
- Container Runtime 

## Kubernetes Objects 
Kubernetes objects are persistent entities in the Kubernetes system. Kubernetes uses these entities to represent the state of your cluster. 

Specifically, they can describe:
- What containerized applications are running (and on which nodes).
- The resources available to those applications.
- The policies around how those applications behave, such as restart policies, upgrades, and fault-tolerance.

Following are the well known objects of k8s:
- Pod
- ReplicaSet 
- Deployment 
- Service 
- Namespace 
- Ingress 
- ConfigMap
- Secret
- PersistantVolume 
- PersistantVolumeClaim 
- StorageClass
